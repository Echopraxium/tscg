## 🎯 Overview

The **Viable System Model (VSM)** is a management cybernetics framework developed by Stafford Beer in the 1970s. It defines organizational viability through **5 recursive subsystems** (S1–S5) managing operations, coordination, optimization, intelligence, and policy.

**Core Principle:** A system is viable if it can maintain separate existence through adaptation to a changing environment.

**Theoretical Foundation:** W. Ross Ashby's **Law of Requisite Variety** — *"Only variety can absorb variety."*

**TSCG Classification:** `m3:SystemicFramework` — an established methodology (50+ years) formalized within the TSCG ontological framework. Not a poclet (non-minimal), not a domain extension (cross-domain by nature).

### Ontology Classification

```
m3:SystemicFramework
    └── M0_VSM (this ontology)
            ├── owl:imports M2_GenericConcepts.jsonld
            └── owl:imports M1_CoreConcepts.jsonld
```

**Why `SystemicFramework`?**
- ✅ Established methodology with 50+ years of documented applications
- ✅ Complete theoretical foundation (Ashby's Law)
- ✅ Validated across multiple domains
- ❌ NOT a minimal poclet (complex, multi-system)
- ❌ NOT a case study (formal, reusable framework)
- ❌ NOT a real-world system (methodological template)

### Namespace

```
m0: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Echopraxium/tscg/main/system-models/M0_VSM.jsonld#
```

All VSM-specific identifiers use the `m0:vsm:` prefix (e.g. `m0:vsm:ViableSystem`, `m0:vsm:VarietyAmplification`).

## 🔬 GenericConceptCombo: VarietyAmplification & VarietyAttenuation

This is the core theoretical contribution of M0_VSM v1.1.0. Two VSM concepts are now formally modeled as **GenericConceptCombo** instances — synergistic combinations of two M2 GenericConcepts via the emergence morphism `⊗⇒`.

### General Pattern

```
GenericConceptCombo(M_A, M_B) ⊗⇒ M_C

    M_A ⊗ M_B  →  shared dimensions COUPLE (not duplicate)
               →  emergent subspace (reduced dimensionality)
               →  M_C is semantically irreducible to M_A or M_B alone
```

Both VarietyAmplification and VarietyAttenuation share the same `parent_A` (`m2:ValueSpace`) and the same base GenericConcept (`m2:Amplification`). The distinction is in `parent_B`: each uses a **different aspect** of `m2:Amplification`'s `dualAspects`.

### Shared Dimensions & Coupling

`m2:ValueSpace` has formula `It⊗V⊗O⊗R⊗Im`.  
`m2:Amplification` (both aspects) has formula `Ft⊗D⊗It⊗R⊗O`.

The three **shared dimensions** `{It, R, O}` couple across parents rather than duplicating:

| Dimension | Coupling Effect |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **It** | Variety cardinality (ValueSpace) couples with signal information content (Amplification) — the variety being scaled IS the information |
| **R** | Value-space representability couples with gain-stage representability — both must be symbolizable in the same model |
| **O** | Variety observability couples with gain observability — the variety at each stage must remain traceable |

This coupling is what produces emergence: the result is a **reduced emergent subspace**, not a naive 8D concatenation of the two parent formulas.

---

### VarietyAmplification

```
GenericConceptCombo(ValueSpace, Amplification↑) ⊗⇒ VarietyAmplification
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **@id** | `m0:vsm:VarietyAmplification` |
| **parent_A** | `m2:ValueSpace` — `It⊗V⊗O⊗R⊗Im` |
| **parent_B** | `m2:Amplification#amplificationAspect` — `Amplification↑`, Gain > 1 |
| **VSM Role** | S2 Coordination — downward flow (metasystem → S1) |
| **Effect** | Increases **Im** (interoperability) so S1 can interpret and execute high-level commands |

**Gain Profile:**

```
Territory:  Ft↑ (more variety flowing down),  It↑ (richer operational detail)
Map:        R maintained (stages representable), O maintained (flow traceable)
```

**Ashby Constraint:** Amplified variety must not exceed S1 operational capacity. Violation → micromanagement pathology (S1 overloaded).

**Examples:**
- S3 *"reduce costs 10%"* → S1: specific supplier renegotiations, process optimizations, headcount freezes
- S4 *"enter Asian market"* → S1: market research tasks, product localization specs, logistics setup
- S5 *"maintain quality ethos"* → S2 standards → S1: specific quality checkpoints per production line
- Software: architectural decision → team-level sprint tasks (decomposition cascade)

**Pathology if absent:** S1 receives abstract directives without operational detail → drift, misalignment, or costly misinterpretation of metasystem intent.

---

### VarietyAttenuation

```
GenericConceptCombo(ValueSpace, Amplification↓) ⊗⇒ VarietyAttenuation
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **@id** | `m0:vsm:VarietyAttenuation` |
| **parent_A** | `m2:ValueSpace` — `It⊗V⊗O⊗R⊗Im` |
| **parent_B** | `m2:Amplification#attenuationAspect` — `Amplification↓`, 0 < Gain < 1 |
| **VSM Role** | S3 Optimization — upward flow (S1 → metasystem) |
| **Effect** | Reduces **O** (observability) for S3 manageability while preserving **V** (verifiability) for audit |

**Gain Profile:**

```
Territory:  Ft↓ (less variety flowing up),  It↓ (compressed operational detail)
Map:        O reduced (less granular for S3), V maintained (audit integrity)
```

**Ashby Constraint:** Attenuated variety must not drop below S3 decision threshold. Violation → blind spots (critical signals lost).

**Verifiability Guard:** V must be preserved throughout the attenuation chain. This is precisely why S3* (audit channel) exists — it bypasses VarietyAttenuation selectively when integrity is suspected. S3* is the V-preservation mechanism in action.

**Examples:**
- S1 raw production data → S3: exception-based dashboard (only deviations reported)
- S1 individual transaction logs → S3: aggregated KPI summary (statistical process control)
- S1 detailed project timelines → S3: milestone-level status (hierarchical filtering)
- S1 sensor readings → S3: trend alerts with confidence intervals
- Software: microservice logs → ops dashboard: error rate, latency percentiles

**Pathology if absent:** S3 receives unfiltered S1 variety → cognitive overload, decision paralysis, inability to distinguish signal from noise (*"variety overload"* in Beer's diagnostics).

### Side-by-side Comparison

| Attribute | VarietyAmplification | VarietyAttenuation |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **Formula** | `GenericConceptCombo(ValueSpace, Amplification↑)` | `GenericConceptCombo(ValueSpace, Amplification↓)` |
| **parent_B aspect** | `amplificationAspect` (↑) | `attenuationAspect` (↓) |
| **Gain** | G > 1 | 0 < G < 1 |
| **Flow direction** | Downward (metasystem → S1) | Upward (S1 → metasystem) |
| **VSM system** | S2 (Coordination) | S3 (Optimization) |
| **Dimension effect** | Im ↑ (interoperability) | O ↓ (observability) |
| **Guard dimension** | — | V preserved (audit) |
| **Pathology if absent** | Drift / misalignment | Variety overload |

## ⚙️ Variety Engineering

`m0:vsm:VarietyEngineering` is Beer's practice of deliberately managing organizational variety. It is the **operational methodology** that employs the two GenericConceptCombos above as its core mechanisms.

```
VarietyEngineering
    ├── Amplification cascade  →  uses VarietyAmplification  (G > 1,  ↓ flow)
    └── Attenuation cascade    →  uses VarietyAttenuation    (0<G<1, ↑ flow)
```

**Amplification Techniques (downward):**
- Policy → Strategy → Tactics → Operations cascade
- Central directive → Local contextualization
- Template → Customization
- General principle → Specific implementation

**Attenuation Techniques (upward):**
- Aggregation (summarize details)
- Exception reporting (report only deviations)
- Statistical process control (monitor trends not instances)
- Hierarchical filtering (each level reduces detail)

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Requisite Variety

**Ashby's Law:** `V(Regulator) ≥ V(Disturbance)`

Formalized via `m2:ValueSpace` (It dimension = variety cardinality). The two GenericConceptCombos are the operational instruments that satisfy this constraint: amplification provides sufficient variety downward, attenuation keeps variety manageable upward.

### Recursive Viability

Every viable system contains viable subsystems, each with a complete S1–S5 structure. Recursion continues until further decomposition loses operational meaning. Instantiates `m2:Imbrication`.

```
Corporation → Division → Department → Team → Individual
Organism    → Organ system → Organ → Tissue → Cell
Nation      → Province → City → District → Neighborhood
```

### Autonomy vs Cohesion

**Beer's Dictum:** *"Maximum local freedom; minimum central constraint."*

- **S1 decides HOW** to achieve targets (Autonomy)
- **S3 negotiates WHAT** targets are needed (Accountability)
- **S5 defines WHY** — purpose and values (Cohesion)

### Algedonic Signal

Emergency alert from S1 directly to S3, **bypassing S2**. Etymology: Greek *algos* (pain) + *hedone* (pleasure). Purpose: immediate escalation of critical problems when normal variety-attenuated channels would be too slow.

### Resource Bargain

Iterative negotiation between S3 (resource allocation) and S1 (operational needs). S1 requests resources; S3 negotiates performance commitments. Balances systemic optimization with operational autonomy.

### S3↔S4 Homeostat

S3 and S4 are coupled: S3 wants operational stability, S4 wants strategic change. S5 arbitrates when they cannot reach consensus. S4 must also attenuate environmental variety before passing it to S3.
