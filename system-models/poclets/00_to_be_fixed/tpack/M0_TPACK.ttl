    rdfs:comment "CRITICAL TEST CASE for ORIVE validation. TPACK is a pedagogical FRAMEWORK (Map) for understanding teacher knowledge domains in technology-integrated teaching. It's a 'Map of a Map' - a meta-model for designing instructional models. Demonstrates BALANCE (Territory: observable teacher competencies) and TRADE-OFF (Map: design decisions balancing T, P, C constraints). TPACK tests whether ORIVE dimensions capture Map quality for conceptual frameworks." ;
