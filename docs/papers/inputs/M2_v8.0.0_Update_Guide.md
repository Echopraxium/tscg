# M2 Ontology Update: Version 8.0.0
## Major Restructuring - Axes Removal and Composition/Decomposition Promotion

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Previous Version**: 7.2.0  
**New Version**: 8.0.0  
**Type**: Major breaking change

---

## Executive Summary

Version 8.0.0 represents a **major simplification** of the M2 ontology architecture:

1. ✅ **Removed all three axes** (tripleAxes framework)
2. ✅ **Promoted Composition/Decomposition** from Axis 3 to dual metaconcepts
3. ✅ **Simplified metaconcept structure** (removed 3 properties from all 50 existing metaconcepts)
4. ✅ **Added 2 new metaconcepts** (51-52): Composition and Decomposition
5. ✅ **Documented Map-Territory principle** separately as theoretical foundation

**Rationale**: The axes framework created unnecessary complexity and was not truly orthogonal. Map-Territory distinction is now documented as a theoretical foundation (see `TSCG_Map_Territory_Theoretical_Foundation.md`) rather than implemented in the ontology structure.

---

## Changes in Detail

### 1. Removed: Triple Axes Framework

**Previous structure** (v7.2.0):
```json
"m2:tripleAxes": {
  "m2:axis1": {
    "m2:name": "Ontological Nature",
    "m2:values": ["ModelSpace", "RealitySpace", "DualNature"]
  },
  "m2:axis2": {
    "m2:name": "Operational Direction",
    "m2:values": ["Analytical", "Constructive", "DualProjection"]
  },
  "m2:axis3": {
    "m2:name": "Granularity Direction",
    "m2:values": ["Composition", "Decomposition", "Bidirectional", "N/A"]
  }
}
```

**New structure** (v8.0.0):
```
(removed completely)
```

**Why removed**:
- Axis 1 (Model/Reality) and Axis 3 (Composition/Decomposition) were not truly orthogonal to Axis 2 (Analytical/Constructive)
- Created redundancy and confusion
- Map-Territory distinction is more fundamental and deserves separate theoretical treatment
- Composition/Decomposition are operations, not just properties → promoted to metaconcepts

---

### 2. Removed: Three Properties from All Metaconcepts

**Removed from all 50 existing metaconcepts**:

1. `m2:hasOntologicalNature` (ModelSpace/RealitySpace/DualNature)
2. `m2:hasOperationalDirection` (Analytical/Constructive/DualProjection)
3. `m2:hasGranularityDirection` (Composition/Decomposition/Bidirectional/N/A)

**Example** (Homeostasis):

**Before** (v7.2.0):
```json
{
  "@id": "m2:Homeostasis",
  "m2:hasTensorFormula": "A⊗S⊗F",
  "m2:hasCategory": "m2:Regulatory",
  "m2:hasOntologicalNature": "RealitySpace",        ← REMOVED
  "m2:hasOperationalDirection": "Constructive",     ← REMOVED
  "m2:hasGranularityDirection": "N/A",              ← REMOVED
  "m2:hasEpistemicGap": 0.2,
  "m2:hasPolarity": "neutral"
}
```

**After** (v8.0.0):
```json
{
  "@id": "m2:Homeostasis",
  "m2:hasTensorFormula": "A⊗S⊗F",
  "m2:hasCategory": "m2:Regulatory",
  "m2:hasEpistemicGap": 0.2,
  "m2:hasPolarity": "neutral"
}
```

**Remaining properties** for each metaconcept:
- `m2:hasTensorFormula` (ASFID tensor product)
- `m2:hasCategory` (Structural, Dynamic, Regulatory, etc.)
- `m2:hasDominantM3` (which M3 dimensions dominate)
- `m2:hasEpistemicGap` (0-1 value)
- `m2:hasPolarity` (neutral or dual)
- `m2:hasExample` (transdisciplinary examples)
- `m2:dualOf` (if dual polarity)

---

### 3. Added: Composition/Decomposition Metaconcept (51)

**Full Definition** (dual intrinsic structure):

```json
{
  "@id": "m2:Composition",
  "@type": ["owl:NamedIndividual", "m2:MetaConcept"],
  "rdfs:label": "Composition (Composition/Decomposition)",
  "rdfs:comment": "Bidirectional structural operation: aggregation of parts into emergent whole (composition) or partition of whole into constituents (decomposition).",
  "m2:hasCategory": "m2:Structural",
  "m2:hasTensorFormula": "S⊗I⊗A (composition) / S⊗I (decomposition)",
  "m2:hasDominantM3": ["m3:Structure", "m3:Information", "m3:Attractor"],
  "m2:hasEpistemicGap": 0.25,
  "m2:hasPolarity": "dual",
  "m2:shortName": "Composition",
  "m2:fullName": "Composition/Decomposition",
  "m2:dualAspects": {
    "compositionAspect": {
      "name": "Composition",
      "direction": "Bottom-up",
      "formula": "S⊗I⊗A",
      "comment": "Aggregation of elementary parts into emergent whole"
    },
    "decompositionAspect": {
      "name": "Decomposition",
      "direction": "Top-down",
      "formula": "S⊗I",
      "comment": "Partition of whole into elementary constituents"
    }
  },
  "m2:hasExample": [
    "Composition: LEGO bricks → construction",
    "Decomposition: Construction → LEGO bricks",
    "Composition: Atoms → molecule (H₂ + O → H₂O)",
    "Decomposition: Molecule → atoms (H₂O → H₂ + O)",
    "Composition: Fuel + O₂ + Heat → Flame",
    "Decomposition: Flame → Fuel, O₂, Heat (forensics)",
    "Composition: R + G + B → Color",
    "Decomposition: Color → (R, G, B) triplet"
  ]
}
```

**Key Properties**:
- **Tensor Formula**: S⊗I⊗A (Structure + Information + Attractor)
  - S: Spatial/topological arrangement
  - I: Assembly rules, interfaces
  - A: Convergence toward stable configuration, emergence
- **Category**: Structural
- **Polarity**: Dual (positive)
- **Nature**: Bottom-up aggregation creating emergent whole

**Key Properties**:
- **Composition aspect**:
  - Formula: S⊗I⊗A (Structure + Information + Attractor)
  - Direction: Bottom-up
  - Nature: Aggregation creating emergent whole
  
- **Decomposition aspect**:
  - Formula: S⊗I (Structure + Information)
  - Direction: Top-down
  - Nature: Analytical partition operation

**Why asymmetric formulas?**
Composition involves convergence toward stable configuration and emergence (A term), while Decomposition is a static partition operation without convergence (no A term). This reflects their different natures: dynamic process vs analytical operation.

**Structure**: Dual intrinsic (like Coding, Convergence) - ONE metaconcept with two aspects, not two separate metaconcepts.

### 4. Updated: Dual Polarity Pairs

### 4. Updated: Dual Polarity Pairs

**Previous** (v7.2.0): 5 dual intrinsic metaconcepts

**New** (v8.0.0): 6 dual intrinsic metaconcepts

| # | Metaconcept | Dual Aspects | Formula |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | Coding | Encoding / Decoding | I⊗S⊗D |
| 2 | Synergy | Synergy / Antagonism | A⊗S⊗I |
| 3 | Fusion | Fusion / Fission | S⊗F⊗D |
| 4 | Activation | Activation / Deactivation | A⊗I⊗D |
| 5 | Convergence | Convergence / Divergence | A⊗D |
| **6** | **Composition** | **Composition / Decomposition** | **S⊗I⊗A / S⊗I** |

**Note**: Composition is the only dual metaconcept with **asymmetric formulas** between its two aspects. This intentionally reflects their different natures (convergent aggregation vs static partition).

---

### 5. Updated: Critical Decisions

**New entry** in `m2:criticalDecisions`:

```json
"m2:axes_removed_v8": "Triple axes framework (Model/Reality, Analytical/Constructive, Composition/Decomposition) removed. Replaced by: Map-Territory distinction documented as theoretical foundation (see TSCG_Map_Territory_Theoretical_Foundation.md). Composition/Decomposition promoted to dual metaconcepts."
```

This documents the architectural decision for future reference.

---

### 6. Updated: Progress Metrics

| Metric | v7.2.0 | v8.0.0 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Metaconcepts Defined** | 50 | 51 | +1 |
| **Metaconcepts Total** | 50 | 51 | +1 |
| **Completion %** | 100% | 100% | - |
| **Neutral Polarity** | 45 | 45 | - |
| **Dual Polarity** | 5 | 6 | +1 |

**Note**: Completion remains 100% - the target has increased from 50 to 51.

## Impact on Usage

### For Users of M2 Ontology

**Breaking changes**:
1. Properties `hasOntologicalNature`, `hasOperationalDirection`, `hasGranularityDirection` no longer exist
2. Queries filtering by these properties will fail
3. SPARQL queries need to be updated
4. Composition/Decomposition is now ONE dual intrinsic metaconcept, not two separate metaconcepts

**Example SPARQL update needed**:

**Old query** (v7.2.0):
```sparql
SELECT ?metaconcept WHERE {
  ?metaconcept m2:hasOntologicalNature "RealitySpace" .
  ?metaconcept m2:hasOperationalDirection "Constructive" .
}
```

**New query** (v8.0.0):
```sparql
# These properties no longer exist
# Filter by category or formula instead:
SELECT ?metaconcept WHERE {
  ?metaconcept m2:hasCategory m2:Regulatory .
}
```

### For Poclet Analysis

**No significant impact** - poclet analysis primarily uses:
- ASFID signatures (M3) - unchanged
- Metaconcept categories - unchanged
- Tensor formulas - unchanged
- Examples - unchanged

**New capability**: Can now explicitly use Composition as a dual intrinsic metaconcept in analysis:
- Composition aspect: Fuel + O₂ + Heat → Flame (Fire Triangle)
- Decomposition aspect: Flame → {Fuel, O₂, Heat} (Forensic analysis)

---

## Migration Guide

### Step 1: Update Code/Queries

Remove any references to:
- `m2:hasOntologicalNature`
- `m2:hasOperationalDirection`
- `m2:hasGranularityDirection`

Replace with:
- `m2:hasCategory` (Structural, Dynamic, Regulatory, etc.)
- `m2:hasTensorFormula` (ASFID tensor products)

### Step 2: Use New Metaconcepts

Where previously you might have described something as "compositional" or "analytical" via axes, now explicitly use:
- `m2:Composition` metaconcept for aggregation processes
- `m2:Decomposition` metaconcept for partition processes

### Step 3: Reference Map-Territory Documentation

For theoretical understanding of Map vs Territory distinction, refer to:
`TSCG_Map_Territory_Theoretical_Foundation.md`

This document explains:
- Observer relativity (fourmi vs humain vs capteur)
- ASFID (Territory-Space) vs ORIVE (Map-Space) proposal
- Why ORIVE is not yet implemented
- Morphisms between spaces

---

## Rationale: Why This Change?

### Problem with Triple Axes

1. **Not truly orthogonal**: 
   - Axis 1 (Model/Reality) overlapped with Axis 2 (Analytical/Constructive)
   - Axis 3 (Composition/Decomposition) overlapped with Axis 2
   - Created confusion and redundancy

2. **Over-specification**:
   - Most metaconcepts were marked "N/A" for Axis 3
   - If an axis doesn't apply to 40% of entities, it's not fundamental

3. **Complexity without clarity**:
   - 3 axes × 3-4 values each = 36 possible combinations
   - Most combinations were empty or redundant
   - Added cognitive load without proportional benefit

### Solution: Simplify + Document

1. **Remove axes** from ontology structure
2. **Promote Composition/Decomposition** to full metaconcepts (they're fundamental operations, not just properties)
3. **Document Map-Territory** separately as theoretical foundation (important principle, not ontology overhead)

**Result**: Cleaner, more mathematically rigorous, easier to understand and use.

---

## Backwards Compatibility

**Version 8.0.0 is NOT backwards compatible** with v7.x.

If you have:
- SPARQL queries using axis properties → must update
- Code parsing axis values → must update
- Documentation referring to triple axes → must update

**Recommendation**: Treat v8.0.0 as new major version requiring migration.

## Conclusion

Version 8.0.0 represents a **major simplification** of M2 architecture:

- **Removed** unnecessary complexity (triple axes)
- **Promoted** fundamental operations (Composition/Decomposition) to proper metaconcepts
- **Documented** deep principles (Map-Territory) separately as theoretical foundation
- **Focused** ontology on what matters: tensor formulas and categories

The framework is now **cleaner, more rigorous, and easier to use** while retaining all essential capabilities.
