## 🎯 Context: What is TSCG?

TSCG (Transdisciplinary System Construction Game) is an **ontological framework** for analyzing and modeling complex systems across disciplines. It provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding systemic patterns through a **bicephalous architecture** that combines Territory measurement (Eagle Eye/ASFID) with Map construction (Sphinx Eye/ORIVE).

### Core Principle
**"The Map is not the Territory"** (Korzybski) - TSCG formalizes this distinction at the foundational M3 level through dual complementary perspectives.

---

## 🏗️ Framework Architecture (4 Layers)

### M3 - Genesis Space (Foundational Basis)
**Complete 10D orthonormal basis** for all TSCG analysis:

**Eagle Eye (ASFID)** - Territory Measurement (5D):
- **A**ttractor: Stable states/equilibria
- **S**tructure: Organization/topology
- **F**low: Movement/circulation
- **I**nformation: Data/knowledge
- **D**ynamics: Change/evolution

**Sphinx Eye (ORIVE)** - Map Construction (5D):
- **O**bservability: Can it be observed?
- **R**eproducibility: Can it be repeated?
- **I**nteroperability: Can it integrate?
- **V**alidity: Is it accurate?
- **E**volvability: Can it adapt/extend?

**Mathematical Properties:**
- Hilbert space: 10D = ASFID(5D) ⊕ ORIVE(5D)
- Orthogonality: ⟨ASFID, ORIVE⟩ = 0 (validated)
- Completeness: ∀s ∈ System: s = α·ASFID + β·ORIVE

---

### M2 - MetaConcepts Layer (Universal Patterns)
**62 transdisciplinary metaconcepts** derived from M3 tensor products.

**NEW in v14.2.0:** Step metaconcept added

**Categories:**
1. **Structural** (15): Topology, Hierarchy, Network, Node, **Step**, Modularity, Symmetry, Component, Hub, Cluster, Path, Pole, etc.
2. **Dynamic** (8): Process, Transformation, Bifurcation, Oscillation, Cycle, etc.
3. **Regulatory** (10): Homeostasis, Regulation, Balance, Trade-off, Constraint, etc.
4. **Adaptive** (4): Resilience, Adaptation, Emergence, Memory
5. **Energetic** (2): Dissipation, Storage
6. **Informational** (6): Code, Language, Signal, Representation, Interface, Channel
7. **Ontological** (8): System, Environment, Observer, State, Substrate, Domain, etc.
8. **Teleonomic** (1): Self-Organization
9. **Relational** (5): Link, Relation, Agent, Role, Mediator
10. **Compositional** (2): Composition, Decomposition
11. **Spatiotemporal** (1): Polarity (N-ary)

**Polarity Distribution:**
- 53 neutral (single manifestation)
- 6 dual (complementary pairs)
- 1 N-ary (Polarity itself: supports N≥2 poles)
- 1 hybrid (Domain: ASFID⊗ORIVE tensor product)

---

### M1 - Domain Extensions (Specialized Concepts)
**Bridge between universal M2 patterns and concrete M0 instances.**

**M1_CoreConcepts** (transdisciplinary):
- Foundation concepts applicable across all domains
- Examples: System, Boundary, Agent, Resource

**Domain Extensions** (5 active):
1. **M1_Biology**: Biological systems (cell, organism, ecosystem)
2. **M1_Chemistry**: Chemical processes (reaction, catalyst, combustion)
3. **M1_Mythology**: Mythological structures (cosmology, pantheon)
4. **M1_Optics**: Optical phenomena (light, reflection, refraction)
5. **M1_Photography**: Photographic concepts (exposure, aperture, ISO)

**Each M1 extension** is an instance of the **m2:Domain** metaconcept with specific 5D tensor structure.

---

### M0 - Poclets (Proof-of-Concept)
**Minimal complete system instances** validating M2 metaconcepts.

**Triple Role of Poclets:**
1. **Proof-of-concept** for TSCG framework itself
2. **Identification** of M2 metaconcept candidates
3. **Population** of M1 core concepts

**Active Poclets (16+):**
- Fire Triangle (combustion)
- Exposure Triangle (photography)
- TPACK (educational technology)
- Yggdrasil (Norse cosmology)
- Butterfly Metamorphosis (biological development)
- Four-Stroke Engine (mechanical cycles)
- Blood Pressure Control (physiological homeostasis)
- Cell Signaling Modes (biological communication)
- Complex Chemical Synapse (neurobiology)
- Adaptive Immune Response (immunology)
- Color Synthesis (RGB, CMY, CMYK, HSL)
- MTG Color Wheel (game design)

## 🆕 What's New in v14.2.0

### New Metaconcept: Step

**Definition:** Specialized Node in sequential/processual context representing a discrete unit of progression in temporal or logical sequences.

**Hierarchical Relationship:**
```
Node (M2 existing - S⊗I)
  ↓ rdfs:subClassOf
Step (M2 new - S⊗I⊗D)
```

**Formula:**
- **Eagle View (ASFID):** S⊗I⊗D
  - S (Structure): Configuration and preconditions
  - I (Information): State at this step
  - D (Dynamics): Transition toward next step
  
- **Sphinx View (ORIVE):** O⊗R⊗I (proposition)
  - O (Observability): Can step be distinguished?
  - R (Reproducibility): Can step be repeated?
  - I (Interoperability): Does step interface with adjacent steps?

**Key Distinctions:**
- **Node vs Step:** Node is spatial/static network entity; Step is temporal/sequential progression unit
- **Step vs State:** State is stable configuration; Step is transition/action
- **Step vs Process:** Process is complete sequence; Step is atomic unit
- **Step vs Phase:** Phase is major period; Step is discrete unit

**Applications:**
- Cooking recipes (étapes: éplucher → couper → cuire)
- Butterfly metamorphosis (phases: egg → larva → pupa → adult)
- Engine cycles (strokes: intake → compression → power → exhaust)
- Algorithms (instructions: input → process → output)
- Manufacturing (stages: cut → assemble → finish)
- Learning progressions (levels: novice → intermediate → expert)

**Validated across 10 domains:** Culinary Arts, Biology, Computer Science, Manufacturing, Music Theory, Animation, Mechanical Engineering, Education, Project Management, Finite Automata

**Proposed by:** Echopraxium  
**Epistemic Gap:** 0.25 (slightly more abstract than Node at 0.2)

## 🎓 Key Principles

### 1. Bicephalous Thinking
Always consider **both perspectives**:
- **Eagle Eye (Territory):** What exists? What can be measured?
- **Sphinx Eye (Map):** How to represent? How valid is the model?

### 2. Epistemic Humility
**Epistemic Gap δ(M)** = difference between Territory and Map
- Small δ: Mature science (physics, chemistry)
- Large δ: Honest acknowledgment of limits (consciousness, social systems)
- **Large δ is not failure** - it's transparency about model boundaries

### 3. Conceptual Stereopsis
Like binocular vision creating depth from two 2D views:
- ASFID + ORIVE → **epistemic depth**
- Domain metaconcept formalizes this through coupling matrix α

### 4. Sequential Modeling with Step
For temporal/processual systems:
- **Process = Sequence<Step>**
- **Cycle = CircularSequence<Step>**
- **Step transforms State_i → State_i+1**

### 5. Transdisciplinarity
Domains intersect when their tensor subspaces overlap:
```
Biophysics = Biology ∩ Physics
Biochemistry = Biology ∩ Chemistry
```

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Identify System Type
- Is it **spatial** (use Node) or **temporal** (use Step)?
- Is it **static** (use State) or **dynamic** (use Process)?
- Is it **continuous** (use Flow) or **discrete** (use Step)?

### Step 2: Apply ASFID (Territory)
Measure observable dimensions:
- **A:** What attracts? What equilibria exist?
- **S:** What structure? What topology?
- **F:** What flows? What circulates?
- **I:** What information? What signals?
- **D:** What dynamics? What changes?

### Step 3: Apply ORIVE (Map)
Evaluate representation quality:
- **O:** Can you observe it clearly?
- **R:** Can you reproduce the results?
- **I:** Does it interoperate with other models?
- **V:** Is it valid/accurate?
- **E:** Can it evolve/adapt?

### Step 4: Identify M2 Metaconcepts
Which universal patterns are present?
- Homeostasis? Balance? Trade-off?
- Hierarchy? Network? Modularity?
- Process? Cycle? Transformation?
- **Step? Node? Path?** ← NEW focus in v14.2.0

### Step 5: Classify M1 Domain
- Which domain(s) does this belong to?
- Is it transdisciplinary (intersection of domains)?
- Does it require new M1 extension?

### Step 6: Validate as Poclet
- Is it minimal yet complete?
- All ASFID dimensions present?
- ORIVE scoring feasible?
- Does it serve as proof-of-concept?

### Step 7: Model Sequential Structure (if applicable)
- Identify discrete Steps in the process
- Define State transitions: State_i → [Step] → State_i+1
- Map complete Process or Cycle

## 🎯 Decision Trees

### When to Use Step vs Node?

```
Is the entity in a SEQUENTIAL context?
├─ YES → Is there a before/after relationship?
│  ├─ YES → Use Step (S⊗I⊗D)
│  └─ NO  → Use Node (S⊗I)
└─ NO  → Use Node (S⊗I)
```

### When to Use Step vs State?

```
Does it represent progression or stability?
├─ PROGRESSION → Use Step
└─ STABILITY   → Use State
```

### When to Use Step vs Process?

```
What's the granularity?
├─ ATOMIC UNIT  → Use Step
└─ FULL SEQUENCE → Use Process (= Sequence<Step>)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with ASFID**: Territory measurement is more concrete than Map construction
2. **Use poclets as anchors**: Ground abstract metaconcepts in concrete examples
3. **Think bicephalously**: Always consider both Eagle (Territory) and Sphinx (Map) perspectives
4. **Domain first**: When analyzing complex knowledge, identify domain structure before diving into details
5. **SVD is your friend**: Use it to find principal modes in coupling matrices
6. **Epistemic humility**: Large δ(M) is not failure—it's honest acknowledgment of limits
7. **NEW: Identify temporal structure**: Look for Steps in sequential systems—they're everywhere once you see them
8. **NEW: Node vs Step decision**: Ask "Is there a before/after order?" If yes, it's probably Step
