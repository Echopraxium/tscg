## 1. POCLET DEFINITION

### 1.1 System Description
The butterfly metamorphosis represents the complete holometabolous lifecycle transformation from egg to adult imago. This poclet captures the full **6-pole architecture** including the critical emergence phase that distinguishes complete metamorphosis from simpler developmental processes.

### 1.2 The Six Poles
1. **Egg** - Initial embryonic state
2. **Larva (Caterpillar)** - Growth phase with successive molts (instars)
3. **Pre-Pupa** - Formation of the chrysalis (last larval molt revealing pupal case)
4. **Pupa (Chrysalis)** - Metamorphic transformation phase
5. **Emergence (Eclosion)** - Critical transition from chrysalis to imago
6. **Imago (Adult)** - Mature, reproductively active butterfly

### 1.3 Key Biological Distinctions
- **Chrysalis ≠ Cocoon**: Chrysalis is the hardened pupal case; cocoon is a silk wrapping (moths)
- **Emergence**: Butterfly does not "exit" its cocoon but **emerges from chrysalis**
- **Eclosion Event**: Chrysalis splits → wet/crumpled butterfly pumps hemolymph into wings → wings harden
- **Vulnerability Window**: Emergence represents maximum predation risk and developmental fragility

### 1.4 Minimality & Completeness
- **Minimal**: 6 poles capture complete holometabolous cycle
- **Complete**: All ASFID dimensions present across lifecycle
- **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrates fundamental biological transformation principle
- **Distinguishing Feature**: Emergence pole separates this from 5-pole simpler metamorphosis models

## 2. ASFID ANALYSIS (Eagle Eye - Territory Perspective)

### 2.1 Attractor (A) - Score: 0.95
**Dominant M3 Dimension**: Strong attractor dynamics toward reproductive maturity

**Analysis**:
- **Primary Attractor**: Adult imago (reproductive fitness)
- **Secondary Attractors**: 
  - Larval feeding optimization (mass accumulation)
  - Pupal transformation completion
- **Stability Basins**: Each pole represents stable developmental state
- **Bifurcation Points**: 
  - Egg → Larva (hatching)
  - Pre-Pupa → Pupa (ecdysis)
  - Pupa → Emergence (eclosion trigger)
- **Irreversibility**: Strong unidirectional attractor field (no regression to earlier poles)

**M2 Metaconcepts Activated**:

  1. **Egg**: Embryonic structure, protective chorion
  2. **Larva**: Segmented body, prolegs, mandibles (feeding specialization)
  3. **Pre-Pupa**: Larval exoskeleton separates from emerging pupal case
  4. **Pupa**: Hardened protective case (chrysalis), internal histolysis
  5. **Emergence**: Transitional state - compressed adult structures expand
  6. **Imago**: Adult morphology - wings, compound eyes, proboscis, reproductive organs

**Radical Restructuring**:
