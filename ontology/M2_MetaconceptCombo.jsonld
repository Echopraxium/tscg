The result is a new metaconcept whose semantic identity cannot be reduced to either parent alone — shared dimensions between parents create epistemic coupling rather than simple concatenation.

The pattern is general — any directed synergistic fusion of two metaconcepts follows the same structural rule (⊗⇒). Formalized as M2 metaconcept to enable systematic instantiation in M1 domain extensions. Originally noted in TO_DO as M1 — corrected to M2 as the generic mechanism belongs at the universal pattern level, while domain-specific instances (VarietyAmplification, VarietyAttenuation) belong in M1."
