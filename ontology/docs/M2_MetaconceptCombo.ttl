    ns1:discoveryContext "Emerged from VSM modeling requirement: VarietyAmplification and VarietyAttenuation each combine two existing M2 metaconcepts (ValueSpace + Amplification) into a new capability that neither parent provides alone. The pattern is general — any directed synergistic fusion of two metaconcepts follows the same structural rule (⊗⇒). Formalized as M2 metaconcept to enable systematic instantiation in M1 domain extensions. Originally noted in TO_DO as M1 — corrected to M2 as the generic mechanism belongs at the universal pattern level, while domain-specific instances (VarietyAmplification, VarietyAttenuation) belong in M1." ;

    ns3:comment "Parameterized metaconcept produced by synergistic combination of two parent metaconcepts via tensor assembly and emergence morphism (⊗⇒). The result is a new metaconcept whose semantic identity cannot be reduced to either parent alone — shared dimensions between parents create epistemic coupling rather than simple concatenation. First metaconcept in M2 whose tensor formula is structural (parameterized) rather than fixed. Instances are domain-specific and belong to M1 extensions via functor_instantiation." ;
