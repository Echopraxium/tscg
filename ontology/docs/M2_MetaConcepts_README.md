**Version:** 15.3.0 · **Date:** 2026-02-18  
**Author:** Echopraxium with the collaboration of Claude AI  
**Layer:** M2 — Transdisciplinary GenericConcepts  
**Category:** `m3:TransdisciplinaryGenericConcepts`

---

## Overview

`M2_GenericConcepts.jsonld` defines the **transdisciplinary pattern layer** of the TSCG (Transdisciplinary System Construction Game) framework. It contains **76 GenericConcepts** — abstract systemic patterns derived as tensor products of M3 basis dimensions (ASFID) that apply universally across scientific disciplines, from biology and physics to economics and computer science.

Each GenericConcept is formalized as a tensor formula over the 5 ASFID dimensions:

| Symbol | Dimension | Role |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **A** | Attractor | Stable states, set points, goals |
| **S** | Structure | Spatial/organizational configurations |
| **F** | Flow | Transfers, currents, exchanges |
| **I** | Information | Signals, codes, representations |
| **D** | Dynamics | Temporal evolution, change |

The M2 layer bridges the M3 mathematical foundation (Genesis Space) and the M1 domain-specific ontologies, acting as a universal vocabulary for transdisciplinary analysis.

## Architecture

```
M3_GenesisSpace.jsonld  (Mathematical foundation — ASFID ⊕ REVOI)
        ↓  imports
M2_GenericConcepts.jsonld  (Universal patterns — tensor products)
        ↓  instantiates
M1_Biology.jsonld, M1_Chemistry.jsonld, …  (Domain concepts)
        ↓  instantiates
M0_RAAS.jsonld, M0_Yggdrasil.jsonld, …  (Concrete systems — Poclets)
```

### Bicephalous Perspective

Each GenericConcept has a dual reading:

- **Eagle Eye (ASFID / Territory):** measures the pattern in the real system
- **Sphinx Eye (REVOI / Map):** constructs a representation of the pattern

The `m2:hasDominantM3` property indicates which ASFID dimensions are primary for each GenericConcept.

## File Structure

```json
{
  "@context": { "@base": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Echopraxium/tscg/main/ontology/", ... },
  "@graph": [
    { "@id": "m2:M2_GenericConcepts",   "@type": "owl:Ontology" },
    { "@id": "m2:GenericConcept",       "@type": "owl:Class" },
    { "@id": "m2:Category",          "@type": "owl:Class" },
    { "@id": "m2:GenericConceptCombo",  "@type": "owl:Class" },
    /* OWL properties (9) */
    /* Category instances (10) */
    /* GenericConcept instances (76) */
  ]
}
```

### `@context` and IRI Resolution

The file uses `@base` to simplify IRIs:

```json
"@context": {
  "@base": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Echopraxium/tscg/main/ontology/",
  "m2": "M2_GenericConcepts.jsonld#",
  "m3": "M3_GenesisSpace.jsonld#"
}
```

So `m2:Homeostasis` resolves to:  
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Echopraxium/tscg/main/ontology/M2_GenericConcepts.jsonld#Homeostasis`

### `owl:imports`

```json
"owl:imports": ["M3_GenesisSpace.jsonld"]

## GenericConceptCombos

A `GenericConceptCombo` is a composite pattern emerging from tensor coupling (⊗⇒) of existing GenericConcepts. It is typed both as `m2:GenericConcept` and `m2:GenericConceptCombo`.

### Cascade
```
Cascade = ⊗⇒(Process, Step, Trajectory)
```
A sequence of processes where each step triggers the next, propagating through a system.

### Processor
```
Processor = ⊗⇒_Territory(Transformation, Flow, Resource)
          × ⊗⇒_Map(Transformation, Representation, Interoperability)
```
A bicephalous transformation unit combining Territory-side processing (what the system does) with Map-side representation (how it is modeled). Bridges Eagle Eye and Sphinx Eye perspectives.

### FeedbackLoop *(v15.3.0)*
```
FeedbackLoop = Process ⊗ Alignment ⊗ Homeostasis
             = (D⊗F) ⊗ (I⊗A⊗S) ⊗ (A⊗S⊗F)
             = A⊗S⊗F⊗I⊗D  (full ASFID coverage)
```
A cyclic regulatory circuit encompassing the complete system phenomenology (all 5 ASFID dimensions):

| Component | Formula | Contribution |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Process | `D⊗F` | Temporal unfolding — sense→compare→act cycle |
| Alignment | `I⊗A⊗S` | Error detection and reduction toward set point |
| Homeostasis | `A⊗S⊗F` | Regulatory target — stable internal state |

**Dual polarity:**
- **Negative feedback** (stabilizing): output opposes deviation. Examples: thermostat, insulin-glucose, PID controller.
- **Positive feedback** (amplifying): output reinforces deviation. Examples: oxytocin in labor, blood clotting cascade, compound interest.

> **Architectural note:** `m2:FeedbackLoop` models systemic regulatory circuits across all domains. It is distinct from `m3:AlignmentLoop` (M3_GenesisSpace), which is the *epistemological* Territory↔Map alignment mechanism intrinsic to TSCG using operators Φ and Ψ.

---

## Notable GenericConcepts

### Alignment *(v15.3.0)*

```
Alignment = I⊗A⊗S   (Information ⊗ Attractor ⊗ Structure)
```

A bidirectional dynamic process progressively reducing mutual discrepancy toward coherent correspondence. Distinct from:

| Concept | Distinction |
|---------|------------|
| Representation | Static structural mapping A→B; Alignment is iterative bidirectional A↔B |
| Balance | Static equilibrium state; Alignment is an active process |
| Convergence | Geometric focusing of trajectories; Alignment is structural/semantic reconciliation |

Examples: DNA sequence alignment, wheel alignment, AI alignment, organizational strategic alignment, Territory↔Map alignment via Φ/Ψ.

### Domain

```
Domain = ∑ᵢ σᵢ |uᵢ⟩⊗|vᵢ⟩    (5D SVD, ASFID ↔ REVOI)
```

A knowledge field formalized as a hybrid tensor product of Territory (ASFID) and Map (REVOI) spaces via Singular Value Decomposition. The σᵢ values encode coupling strength between the two perspectives.

### ValueSpace

```
ValueSpace = It → V → O → R → Im
```

A hybrid variety model encoding the information-theoretic capacity of a system's state space, bridging Territory measurement (It, V, O) and Map construction (R, Im).
