## 🔬 Candidates to Evaluate (9)

### Priority 1: ACCEPT (5)

1. **Convergence/Divergence** (dual) 🟢
   - Category: Dynamic
   - Formula: ∇·D (divergence) / -∇·D (convergence)
   - Nature: RealitySpace
   - Direction: DualProjection
   - Gap: 0.30
   - Rationale: Fundamental flow dynamics, complements Gradient
   - Collision risk: Low (orthogonal to Bifurcation)

2. **Resource** 🟢
   - Category: Energetic
   - Formula: F⊗S
   - Nature: RealitySpace
   - Direction: Constructive
   - Gap: 0.20
   - Rationale: Materiality of flows, complements Dissipation
   - Collision risk: None

3. **Agent** 🟢
   - Category: Relational
   - Formula: S⊗I⊗D
   - Nature: RealitySpace
   - Direction: Constructive
   - Gap: 0.35
   - Rationale: Active entity in interactions (vs Observer: passive)
   - Collision risk: Low (distinct from System, Observer)

4. **Role** 🟢
   - Category: Relational
   - Formula: S⊗I
   - Nature: ModelSpace
   - Direction: Analytical
   - Gap: 0.25
   - Rationale: Functional position in system structure
   - Collision risk: None

5. **Mediator** 🟢
   - Category: Relational
   - Formula: F⊗I⊗S
   - Nature: DualNature
   - Direction: DualProjection
   - Gap: 0.30
   - Rationale: Intermediary enabling interaction
   - Collision risk: Low

### Priority 2: CONSIDER (2)

6. **Relation** 🟡
   - Category: Relational
   - Formula: S⊗I (or I⊗I?)
   - Collision risk: MODERATE - overlaps with Network edges, Language links
   - Decision: **REJECT** - too generic, covered by Network topology
   - Alternative: Use "Coupling" if specific bond semantics needed

7. **Temporality** 🟡
   - Category: Ontological?
   - Formula: D? (or temporal integration?)
   - Collision risk: MODERATE - time is external parameter in M3
   - Decision: **REJECT** - violates M3 design (time external)
   - Note: Temporal aspects covered by Memory, Process, Event, Trajectory

### Priority 3: REJECT (2)

8. **Space** 🔴
   - Rationale: Space/spatiality is encoded in Structure (S), not separate metaconcept
   - Collision: HIGH - redundant with Structure, Topology implicit in S
   - Decision: **REJECT**

9. **Tropism** 🔴
   - Rationale: Biology-specific term (phototropism, chemotropism)
   - Collision: MODERATE - covered by Gradient + Attractor interaction
   - Decision: **REJECT** - violates purity principle (domain-specific)
   - Alternative: Use "Oriented Response" only if needed in M1 biological extension

## 🧬 Collision Matrix

### Semantic Proximity Map

```
Homeostasis ↔ Regulation (inclusion: Homeostasis ⊆ Regulation)
Resilience ↔ Robustness (near-synonyms, keep Resilience)
Adaptation ↔ Self-Organization (orthogonal: directed vs spontaneous)
Constraint ↔ Threshold (orthogonal: static vs dynamic)
Trigger ↔ Event (orthogonal: cause vs occurrence)
System ↔ Environment (dual: interior/exterior)
Observer ↔ Agent (orthogonal: passive/active)
Code ↔ Language (inclusion: Language ⊇ Code)
Synergy ↔ Emergence (orthogonal: interaction vs novelty)
Convergence ↔ Attractor (semantic link: convergence → attractor)
Gradient ↔ Flow (causal: gradient drives flow)
```
