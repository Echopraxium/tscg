    ns1:discoveryContext "Identified as missing metaconcept during TO_DO review. Pattern occupies a unique niche: it bridges observation (Territory) and reuse (Map) through structural recurrence. No existing metaconcept captured both the recurring regularity aspect and the cross-domain template reusability in a single concept." ;

    ns3:comment "Recurring structural motif identifiable across instances and reusable as a template. Exists as an observable regularity in Territory (Eagle Eye) and as a reusable archetype in Map (Sphinx Eye). The key discriminator vs related concepts is the combination of recurrence (vs Signature) and cross-domain reusability (vs Representation)." ;
