## Overview

The **M3 Genesis** ontology defines the foundational layer of the TSCG (Transdisciplinary System Construction Game) framework. It establishes a **5-dimensional orthonormal Hilbert space** serving as a vectorial basis for transdisciplinary systemic modeling.

**Analogy**: If TSCG is "LEGO Technic for systems", M3 provides the standardized **elementary bricks**.

## The 5 ASFID Dimensions

### Fundamental Principle
Each dimension represents an **orthonormal basis vector** in the complex space ℂ⁵, verifying:
- **Orthonormality**: ⟨k|j⟩ = δ_kj (null scalar product between distinct dimensions)
- **Completeness**: ∑|k⟩⟨k| = 𝟙 (complete basis)
- **Normalization**: ‖|k⟩‖ = 1 (unit vectors)

### 1. |A⟩ ATTRACTOR
**Concept**: System's tendency toward stable asymptotic states.

**Range**: [0,1]
- 0 = Chaotic behavior, no convergence
- 0.5 = Oscillations around attractors
- 1 = Strong convergence toward fixed point

**Examples**:
- Damped pendulum: A ≈ 0.9 (converges to rest)
- Atmospheric turbulence: A ≈ 0.2 (strange attractor)
- Body homeostasis: A ≈ 0.8 (regulated temperature)

**Measurement**: Lyapunov exponents, attraction basins

---

### 2. |S⟩ STRUCTURE
**Concept**: Topological organization and system connectivity.

**Range**: [0,1]
- 0 = Gas (no persistent structure)
- 0.5 = Liquid (temporary local structure)
- 1 = Crystal (maximal rigid structure)

**Examples**:
- DNA: S ≈ 0.95 (stable double helix)
- Social network: S ≈ 0.6 (defined communities)
- Plasma: S ≈ 0.1 (weak organization)

**Measurement**: Graphs, adjacency matrices, topological invariants

---

### 3. |F⟩ FLOW
**Concept**: Exchanges with environment, thermodynamic openness.

**Range**: [0.1,1] ⚠️ **Universal Openness Axiom**: F ≥ 0.1
- 0.1 = Quasi-closed (ideal isolated system impossible)
- 0.5 = Exchange/autonomy balance
- 1 = Totally dissipative (maximal flow)

**Examples**:
- Living cell: F ≈ 0.7 (active metabolism)
- Thermos: F ≈ 0.15 (thermal insulation)
- Tornado: F ≈ 0.95 (intense energy dissipation)

**Measurement**: Entropy production, metabolic flows

**Justification for F ≥ 0.1**: No real system is totally closed (gravitational, quantum interactions, cosmic radiation).

---

### 4. |I⟩ INFORMATION
**Concept**: Internal state complexity (synchronic).

**Range**: [0,1]
- 0 = Simple state (few bits)
- 0.5 = Moderate complexity
- 1 = Maximal admissible complexity

**Examples**:
- Salt crystal: I ≈ 0.1 (regular repetition)
- Human genome: I ≈ 0.85 (3 billion base pairs)
- Hydrogen atom: I ≈ 0.05 (few states)

**Measurement**: Shannon entropy, Kolmogorov complexity

**Note**: I measures **diversity of possible states**, not uncertainty (entropy).

---

### 5. |D⟩ DYNAMICS
**Concept**: Rate of internal change, evolution speed.

**Range**: [0,1]
- 0 = Static (no evolution)
- 0.5 = Moderate evolution
- 1 = Explosive transformation

**Examples**:
- Metamorphic rock: D ≈ 0.01 (slow geological change)
- Fast chemical reaction: D ≈ 0.9 (combustion)
- Developing organism: D ≈ 0.7 (active growth)

**Measurement**: Time derivatives, reaction rates

**Relation with F**: D measures **internal change**, F measures **external exchanges**. A system can have high D and low F (e.g., contained nuclear fission).

---

## Orthogonality: Proofs and Justifications

### Verification Matrix (10 pairs)

| Pair | Independence demonstrated | Counter-factual example |
|------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| A⊥S | Attractor ≠ Topology | Gas (low S) can have attractor (high A in convection) |
| A⊥F | Stability ≠ Openness | Homeostasis (high A) requires medium F |
| A⊥I | Convergence ≠ Complexity | Crystal (high A, low I) vs stable ecosystem (high A and I) |
| A⊥D | Asymptote ≠ Speed | Equilibrium (high A, low D) vs damped oscillations (medium A and D) |
| S⊥F | Graph ≠ Flow | Rigid network (high S) can be open (high F) or isolated (low F) |
| S⊥I | Topology ≠ States | DNA (high S and I) vs crystal (high S, low I) |
| S⊥D | Organization ≠ Rate | Stable structure (high S) can evolve rapidly (high D) |
| F⊥I | Exchange ≠ Memory | Constant flow (high F) with weak or strong memory |
| F⊥D | Openness ≠ Change | Dissipation (high F) can maintain stable state (low D) |
| I⊥D | Complexity ≠ Speed | Complex system (high I) can be static (low D) |

**Verdict**: ✅ **10/10 orthogonal pairs** (complete validation)

### Instructive Counter-examples

**A vs D**: An oscillating pendulum has high D but low A (no convergence), while a damped pendulum has high A and decreasing D.

**S vs F**: A diamond (S ≈ 1, perfect crystalline structure) can be in a furnace (F ≈ 0.8, intense thermal exchanges).

**I vs D**: Software source code (high I, algorithmic complexity) may never change (D ≈ 0).

## Critical Modeling Choices

### 1. ASFID Order (IMMUTABLE)
**Decision**: A → S → F → I → D

**Reason**: Avoid problematic acronyms (AIDS/SIDA in English/French).

**Rejected alternatives**:
- SIDAF, FISAD, DASIF, etc. (all tested and discarded)

**Impact**: Purely conventional order, no semantic hierarchy.

---

### 2. External Time (t ∉ M3)
**Decision**: Time is a **parameter**, not a 6th dimension.

**Formula**: |Ω(t)⟩ where t ∈ ℝ

**Justification**:
1. **Universality**: Time affects all dimensions uniformly
2. **Parsimony**: Avoids redundancy with D (which measures ∂|Ω⟩/∂t)
3. **Physical coherence**: Consistent with quantum mechanics (t = evolution parameter)

**Consequence**: Temporal GenericConcepts (Memory, Trajectory) require integration → they are in M2, not M3.

---

### 3. Flow is M3 (F ≥ 0.1)
**Decision**: F is fundamental dimension with openness axiom.

**Corrected error**: Initially, "Flow" was a redundant M2 GenericConcept with F.

**Justification**:
- **Thermodynamics**: Every real system exchanges with its environment
- **Coherence**: F distinguishes closed systems (F ≈ 0.1) from open ones (F > 0.5)
- **Universality**: Applicable from quantum (entanglement) to cosmological (radiation)

---

### 4. Positive Coefficients (a,s,f,i,d ≥ 0)
**Decision**: All state vector coefficients are non-negative.

**Justification**:
- **Interpretability**: Negative values have no physical meaning (e.g., "negative flow" = confusion with direction)
- **Normalization**: [0,1] suffices for any variation (0 = absence, 1 = maximum)
- **Simplicity**: Avoids semantic ambiguities

**Polarities**: Handled at M2 level (dual GenericConcepts like Coherence/Entropy), not M3.

---

## Mathematical Formalisms

### State Vector
```
|Ω⟩ = a|A⟩ + s|S⟩ + f|F⟩ + i|I⟩ + d|D⟩
```
where (a,s,f,i,d) ∈ [0,1]⁵ with f ≥ 0.1

### Scalar Product
```
⟨Ω₁|Ω₂⟩ = a₁a₂ + s₁s₂ + f₁f₂ + i₁i₂ + d₁d₂
```

### Norm
```
‖|Ω⟩‖ = √(a² + s² + f² + i² + d²)
```

### Identity Operator
```
𝟙 = |A⟩⟨A| + |S⟩⟨S| + |F⟩⟨F| + |I⟩⟨I| + |D⟩⟨D|
```

### Projection
```
P_A|Ω⟩ = a|A⟩  (attractor component)
```

  "m3:range": { "m3:min": 0, "m3:max": 1 },
  "m3:orthogonalTo": ["S", "F", "I", "D"]
}
```

**Interpretation**: Each dimension is a basis vector with metrological constraints.

{
  "m3:orthogonalityVerified": true,
  "m3:pairsTested": 10,
  "m3:pairsValidated": 10
}
```

**Usage**: Computational proof of independence.

## Relations with M2 (Upper Layer)

### Tensorization
M2 GenericConcepts are constructed by **tensor products** of M3 dimensions:

**Order 1** (linear, 5 terms):
```
|M⟩₁ = ∑ cᵢ|i⟩  (i ∈ {A,S,F,I,D})
```
Example: Dissipation ≈ c_F|F⟩ (Flow dominant)

**Order 2** (couplings, 25 terms):
```
|M⟩₂ = ∑ cᵢⱼ|i⟩⊗|j⟩
```
Example: Regulation ≈ c_ASF|A⟩⊗|S⟩⊗|F⟩ (attractor + structure + flow)

**Order 3** (complex interactions, 125 terms):
```
|M⟩₃ = ∑ cᵢⱼₖ|i⟩⊗|j⟩⊗|k⟩
```

### M3→M2 Derivation Examples

| M2 GenericConcept | Tensorial Formula | Justification |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Homeostasis | A⊗S⊗F | Attractor (stability) + Structure (organization) + Flow (controlled exchange) |
| Memory | ∫(D - F)dτ | Temporal integration of (internal change - dissipation) |
| Bifurcation | ∂D/∂F | Abrupt transition when flow modifies dynamics |
| Emergence | I⊗S⊗D | Complexity + Organization + Evolution → global property |

**Principle**: M3 provides the **atomic vocabulary**, M2 composes **systemic phrases**.

## Validation Protocols

### Orthogonality Test
For each pair (i,j):
1. Identify systems where i varies independently of j
2. Build counter-examples (high i/low j, low i/high j)
3. Verify ⟨i|j⟩ = 0 conceptually

**Validation criterion**: At least 2 real examples per pair.

### Completeness Test
Verify that no fundamental systemic property can be expressed without combination of at least one M3 dimension.

**Questions**: 
- Can a system exist without Structure (S=0)? → No (even gas has spatial distribution)
- Can we have Information without Dynamics or Attractor? → Yes (static data)

### Minimality Test
No dimension can be derived from the other 4.

**Failed counter-test**: "D = ∂I/∂t" → FALSE (system can change without gaining complexity)

## Limitations and Future Extensions

### Current Limitations
1. **Discretization**: [0,1] is an approximation (reality = continuous)
2. **Subjective measures**: Normalization depends on domain
3. **Linearity**: No cross-terms in M3 (reserved for M2)

### Envisioned Extensions
1. **M3.5** (hypothetical): Quadratic terms like |A⟩² (non-linearities)
2. **Fock spaces**: For quantum systems (creation/annihilation)
3. **Adaptive metrics**: Variable weights by domain

### Non-Extensions (Final Decisions)
- ❌ **6th temporal dimension**: Time remains external
- ❌ **Negative coefficients**: Polarities handled in M2
- ❌ **Dimension hierarchization**: ASFID order conventional only
