● Now I have a full picture of the ontology. The reasoner can do three genuinely useful things:

  1. ASFID profile — aggregate dominant M3 dims across all candidates, score-weighted → infer the system's dimension fingerprint and suggest a formula                                 2. Family grouping — cluster candidates into Regulatory / Dynamic / Structural etc. families
  3. Composite inference — FeedbackLoop has explicit componentMetaconcepts: [Process, Alignment, Homeostasis] — if all three appear in top candidates, suggest the composite           ⎿  You're out of extra usage · resets 2am (Europe/Brussels)
